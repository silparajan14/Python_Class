#multithreading :
#thread : a thread is the smallest unit of a program or process executed independently
#or sheduled by the operating system.

#process : a complete program is known as process

#difference btw single thread and multi thread :
#single thread process that can't take the execution of instructions
# in a single sequence. in other words one program at a time.

#the opposite of single threaded process is called multi thread process.
#this process allow the execution of multiple parts of a program
#at the same time.
