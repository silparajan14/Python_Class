#         x +=1
# print(x)
# EXPLANATION :
# The code you provided initializes a variable x to 0. Then, it enters a 'for loop' that iterates 10 times.
# Within that loop, there is another nested 'for loop' that iterates from -1 to -9 (inclusive) nine times.
# During each iteration of the nested loop, the variable x is incremented by 1.
# This means that the nested loop will execute a total of 10 x 9 = 90 times, and
# each time it executes, it will add 1 to the value of x.
# After all the iterations of the loops have completed, the value of x is printed to the console.
# Because x was incremented 90 times during the nested loop, its final value will be 90.
#
# So, the output of this code will be: 90

# x = 0
# for i in range(10):
#     for j in range(-1,-10,-1):
#         x +=1
#     print(x)
# here, it will print each x, ie, from 9,18,27,...90

# a,b = 12,-12
